Third Assignment:

Refork the GIT repo.
Then create a subdirectory with your initials and the year (for example ah2014) 
Within that folder, copy your files from the other two days into subfolders
entitled task1 and task2 respectively. 
Create a new folder, entitled quiz-week1.
Please put together in a simple text fle a quiz of three questions regarding
concepts you have learned so far this week.  The questions should be
open-ended/fill-in-the-blanks.  Save two versions as quiz.txt and 
quiz-solutions.txt (one with just the questions, one with both questions
and answers). 
Commit your files, then create a Pull Request on GitHub.
