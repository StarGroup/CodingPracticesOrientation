1. What are some of the ways in which commenting can be used while coding?
   Commenting is used to explain sections or parts of code to improve the readability
   of a file preventing the need of others to decipher the code in its entirety. It
   can also be used to clarify closing brackets in large, nested conditionals and loops.
   Finally, it can be useful when debugging by commenting out certain parts of code to
   determine issues.

2. Before attempting to push file(s) with git, the add argument must first be used
   to flag the files then the commit argument is used to finalize the push.

3. To improve readability of PHP pages containing large amounts of text (such as disclaimers
    and other long documents), the include function is used. This differs from the require/require_once
    function in that the program will still execute without the file(s).
