Task 2:

Guide to HTML Forms:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms


PHP manual for $_POST & $_GET:
http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.get.php
http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.post.php


Every form needs an action- this is the page that actually processes the data


Form should include:
first name text field
last name text field
email address field

Form action should post back to itself, php needs to sterilize/sanitize data and generate an email.
