Fork this GIT repository within GitHub.
Then, create a basic HTML page, with what you perceive as the most critical DOM elements required for any webpage.
Requirements for the HTML page: a) loading the jQuery library (1.x branch) from a CDN b) including an external CSS stylesheet that defines a color or font-setting on an element in your webpage. c) embed at least one image in your html page (perhaps a logo in what would be considered a header). d) your webpage should utilize at least 4 DOM elements/nodes within the
tag.
